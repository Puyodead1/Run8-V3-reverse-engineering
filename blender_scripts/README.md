import/export scripts for blender, these would be made into an `io_scene_run8` addon at some point.

I cannot for the life of me get skeleton import working for avatars.

currently includes:
- Avatars
  - Mesh Import
  - Mesh Export (won't work though due to needing animations and armature)
- Railcar Models
  - Mesh Import
